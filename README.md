***

A multiplatform object-oriented gui framework written in **C++**. This framework is mainly aimed towards game hacking, but you can use it for anything you want.

* Easy to use and to customize.
* Works on multiple graphics libraries. (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, etc)
* It comes with a built-in config system. (The framework is using [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) as a file parser.)
* Can handle multiple windows at the same time.

_You can visit the [wiki (currently under construction)](https://github.com/otvv/fgui/wiki) page for elements documentation and a how to setup guide._
